##
## createDocumentation.py: automagically creates documentation for all files in the current folder by extracting this documentation line from all files. 
## Created by: Fredrik Walloe
## Creation date: 8-12-2018
## Version: 0.1
## Status: Incomplete
##
## Usage: run the script in the folder that contains the files you want to document; for this to work, all files must have a line that contains the file name followed by a colon and then a discription of what the script does. It is this line that will be automatically extracted.
